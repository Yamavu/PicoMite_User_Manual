### PORT(start, nbr [,start, nbr]â€¦) = value

Set a number of I/O pins simultaneously (i.e. with one command). 'start' is an I/O pin number and the lowest bit in 'value' (bit 0) will be used to set that pin. Bit 1 will be used to set the pin 'start' plus 1, bit 2 will set pin 'start'+2 and so on for 'nbr' number of bits. I/O pins used must be numbered consecutively and any I/O pin that is invalid or not configured as an output will cause an error. The start/nbr pair can be repeated if an additional group of output pins needed to be added. For example; PORT(15, 4, 23, 4) = &B10000011 Will set eight I/O pins. Pins 15 and 16 will be set high while 17, 18, 23, 24 and 25 will be set to a low and finally 26 will be set high. This command can be used to conveniently communicate with parallel devices like LCD displays. Any number of I/O pins (and therefore bits) can be used from 1 to the number of I/O pins on the chip. See the PORT function to simultaneously read from a number of pins.
