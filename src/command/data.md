### DATA constant[,constant]..

Stores numerical and string constants to be accessed by READ. In general string constants should be surrounded by double quotes ("). An exception is when the string consists of just alphanumeric characters that do not represent MMBasic keywords (such as THEN, WHILE, etc). In that case quotes are not needed. Numerical constants can also be expressions such as 5 * 60.
