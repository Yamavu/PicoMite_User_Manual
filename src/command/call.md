### CALL usersubname$ [,usersubparameters,..]

 This is an efficient way of programmatically calling user defined subroutines.
 
 In many cases it can allow you to get rid of complex `SELECT` and `IF THEN ELSEIF ENDIF` clauses and is processed in a much more efficient way.

 See also the [CALL() function](../function/call.md).
