### FONT [#]font-number, scaling

This will set the default font for displaying text on an LCD panel or the video output.

Fonts are specified as a number. For example, #2 (the # is optional). 

See the chapter [Graphics Commands and Functions](../graphics_functions.md#fonts) and details of the available [fonts](../fonts.md).

`scaling` can range from 1 to 15 and will multiply the size of the pixels making the displayed character correspondingly wider and higher. Eg, a scale of 2 will double the height and width.
