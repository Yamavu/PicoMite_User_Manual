## IR CLOSE

signal. It can be connected to any pin however this pin must be configured inadvanced using the command: SETPIN n, IRThe IR signal decode is done in the background and the program will continueafter this command without interruption. 'dev' and 'key' should be numericvariables and their values will be updated whenever a new signal is received('dev' is the device code transmitted by the remote and 'key' is the key pressed).'int' is a user defined subroutine that will be called when a new key press isreceived or when the existing key is held down for auto repeat. In the interruptsubroutine the program can examine the variables 'dev' and 'key' and takeappropriate action.The IR CLOSE command will terminate the IR decoder.Note that for the NEC protocol the bits in 'dev' and 'key' are reversed. Forexample, in 'key' bit 0 should be bit 7, bit 1 should be bit 6, etc. This does notaffect normal use but if you are looking for a specific numerical code providedby a manufacturer you should reverse the bits.
