## CAMERA CHANGE image%(),change! [,scale [,x ,y]]

The camera firmware is also able to detect motion in the camera's field of viewusing the command. It does this by operating the camera in YUV mode ratherthan RGB. This has the advantage that the intensity information and colourinformation are separated and just one byte is needed for a 256-level greyscaleimage which is ideal fer detecting movement.image% is an array of size 160x120 bytes (DIM image%(160,120/8-1)On calling the command it holds a packed 8-bit greyscale image.The change! variable returns the percentage the image has changed from theprevious time the command was called.Optionally if "scale" is set then the image delta is output to the screen i.e. thedifference between the previous image and this one. As in the CAPTUREcommand the delta image can be scaled and positioned as required. If the scaleparameter is omitted then the LCD is not updated by this command.
