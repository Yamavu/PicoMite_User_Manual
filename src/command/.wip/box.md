### BOX x, y, w, h [, lw] [,c] [,fill]

 Draws a box on the display with the top left hand corner at 'x' and 'y' with a width of 'w' pixels and a height of 'h' pixels. 'lw' is the width of the sides of the box and can be zero. It defaults to 1. 'c' specifies the colour and defaults to the default foreground colour if not specified. 'fill' is the fill colour. It can be omitted or set to -1 in which case the box will not be filled. All parameters can be expressed as arrays and the software will plot the number of boxes as determined by the dimensions of the smallest array. 'x' and 'y', must both be arrays or be single variables /constants otherwise an error will be generated. 'w', 'h' , 'lw', 'c', and fill can be either arrays or single variables/constants. See the chapter Graphics Commands and Functions for a definition of the colours and graphics coordinates
