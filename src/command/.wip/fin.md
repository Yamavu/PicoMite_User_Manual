 Frequency input 'option' can be used to specify the gate time (the length of time used to count the input cycles). It can be any number between 10 ms and 100000 ms. The PIN() function will always return the frequency correctly scaled in Hz regardless of the gate time used. If 'option' is omitted the gate time will be 1 second. The pins can be GP6, GP7, GP8 or GP9 (can be changed with OPTION COUNT).
