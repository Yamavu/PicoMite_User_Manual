## XMODEM CRUNCH

Note that the data is buffered in RAM which limits the maximum transfer size.This command also creates a backup of the program in flash memory which willbe automatically retrieved if the CPU is reset of the power is lost.The CRUNCH option works like RECEIVE but will remove all comments,blank lines and unnecessary spaces from the program before saving. This canbe used on large programs to allow them to fit into limited memory.SEND, RECEIVE and CRUNCH can be abbreviated to S, R and C.The XModem protocol requires a cooperating software program running on theremote computer and connected to its serial port. It has been tested on TeraTerm running on Windows and it is recommended that this be used.After running the XMODEM command in MMBasic select: File -> Transfer -> XMODEM -> Receive/Send from the Tera Term menu to start the transfer.The transfer can take up to 15 seconds to start and if the XMODEM commandfails to establish communications it will return to the MMBasic prompt after 60seconds and leave the program memory untouched.Download Tera Term from http://ttssh2.sourceforge.jp/
