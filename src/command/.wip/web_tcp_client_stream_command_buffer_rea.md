## WEB TCP CLIENT STREAM command$, buffer%(), readpointer%, writepointer%

Connects to a server previously opened with WEB OPEN TCP STREAM.'command$' is a string and is the request to be sent to the server.'buffer%()' is an integer array which will receive the ongoing responses andacts as a circular buffer of bytes received.The firmware maintains the parameter ‘writepointer%’ as the data from theserver arrives.‘readpointer%’ should be maintained by the Basic program as it removes datafrom the circular buffer.If ‘writepointer%’ catches up with ‘readpointer%’ then ‘readpointer%’ will beincremented to stay one byte ahead and incoming data will be lost.This command is designed to be compatible with the PLAY STREAMcommand to allow the implementation of streaming internet audio.
