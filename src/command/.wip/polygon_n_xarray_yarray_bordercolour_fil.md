## POLYGON n(), xarray%(), yarray%() [, bordercolour] [, fillcolour]

POLYGON n(), xarray%(), yarray%() [, bordercolour()] [, fillcolour()]POLYGON n(), xarray%(), yarray%() [, bordercolour] [, fillcolour]The elements of ‘array n()’ define the number of xy-coordinate pairs in each ofthe polygons. eg, DIM n(1)=(3,3) would define that 2 polygons are to bedrawn with three vertices each. The size of the n array determines the numberof polygons that will be drawn unless an element is found with the value zeroin which case the firmware only processes polygons up to that point. The x,y-coordinate pairs for all the polygons are stored in ‘xarray%()’ and ‘yarray%()’.The ‘xarray%()’ and ‘yarray%()’ parameters must have at least as manyelements as the total of the values in the n array.Each polygon can be closed with the first and last elements the same. If the lastelement is not the same as the first the firmware will automatically create anadditional x,y-coordinate pair to complete the polygon. If fill colour is omittedthen just the polygon outlines are drawn.The colour parameters can be a single value in which case all polygons aredrawn in the same colour or they can be arrays with the same cardinality as ‘n’.In this case each polygon drawn can have a different colour of both borderand/or fill.For example, this will draw 3 triangles in yellow, green and red: DIM c%(2)=(3,3,3) DIM x%(8)=(100,50,150,100,50,150,100,50,150) DIM y%(8)=(50,100,100,150,200,200,250,300,300) DIM fc%(2)=(rgb(yellow),rgb(green),rgb(red)) POLYGON c%(),x%(),y%(),fc%(),fc%()
