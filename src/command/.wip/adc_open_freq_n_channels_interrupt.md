## ADC OPEN freq, n_channels [,interrupt]

This allocates up to 4 ADC channels for use and sets them to be converted atthe specified frequency.The range of pins are GP26, GP27, GP28, and GP29 for the RP2940 andRP2350A. Plus GP40, GP41, GP42, GP43 on the RP2350B. If the number ofchannels is one then it will always be GP26 used, if two then GP26 and GP27are used, etc. Sampling of multiple channels is sequential (there is only oneADC). The pins are locked to the function when ADC OPEN is activeThe maximum total frequency is CPUspeed/96 (eg, 520KHz if all fourchannels are to be sampled with the CPU set at 200MHz). Note that aaggregate sampling frequency over 500Khz is overclocking the ADC.The optional interrupt parameter specifies an interrupt to call when theconversion completes. If not specified then conversion will be blocking
