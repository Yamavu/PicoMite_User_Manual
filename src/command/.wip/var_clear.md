## VAR CLEAR

previously saved will be updated with their new value and any new variables(not previously saved) will be added to the saved list for later restoration.VAR RESTORE will retrieve the previously saved variables and insert them(and their values) into the variable table.VAR CLEAR will erase all saved variables.This command is normally used to save calibration data, options, and otherdata which does not change often but needs to be retained across a powerinterruption. Normally the VAR RESTORE command is placed at the start ofthe program so that previously saved variables are restored and immediatelyavailable to the program when it starts. Notes:  The storage space available to this command is 16KB.  Using VAR RESTORE without a previous save will have no effect and will not generate an error.  If, when using RESTORE, a variable with the same name already exists its value will be overwritten.  Saved arrays must be declared (using DIM) before they can be restored.  Be aware that string arrays can rapidly use up all the memory allocated to this command. The LENGTH qualifier can be used when a string array is declared to reduce the size of the array (see the DIM command). This is not needed for ordinary string variables.  The saved variables will be automatically cleared by a firmware upgrade, by the NEW command or when a new program is loaded via AUTOSAVE, XMODEM, etc.
