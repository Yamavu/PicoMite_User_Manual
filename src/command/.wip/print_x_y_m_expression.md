## PRINT @(x, [y], m) expression

Same as the standard PRINT command except that the cursor is positioned atthe coordinates x, y expressed in pixels. If y is omitted the cursor will bepositioned at “x” on the current line.Example: PRINT @(150, 45) "Hello World"The @ function can be used anywhere in a print command.Example: PRINT @(150, 45) "Hello" @(150, 55) "World"The @(x,y) function can be used to position the cursor anywhere on or off thescreen. For example, PRINT @(-10, 0) "Hello" will only show "llo" as thefirst two characters could not be shown because they were off the screen.The @(x,y) function will automatically suppress the automatic line wrapnormally performed when the cursor goes beyond the right screen margin.If 'm' is specified the mode of the video operation will be as follows:m = 0 Normal text (white letters, black background)m = 1 The background will not be drawn (ie, transparent)m = 2 The video will be inverted (black letters, white background)m = 5 Current pixels will be inverted (transparent background)
