The CRUNCH option instructs MMBasic to remove all comments, blank linesand unnecessary spaces from the program before saving. This can be used onlarge programs to allow them to fit into limited memory. CRUNCH can beabbreviated to the single letter C.The APPEND option will leave the existing program intact and append the newdata from the serial input to the end of it.At any time this command can be aborted by Control-C which will leaveprogram memory untouched.This is one way of transferring a BASIC program into the Raspberry Pi Pico.The program to be transferred can be pasted into a terminal emulator and thiscommand will capture the text stream and store it into program memory. It canalso be used for entering a small program directly at the console input.NON VGA OR HDMI VERSIONS
