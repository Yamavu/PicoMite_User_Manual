### CONTINUE

Resume running a program that has been stopped by an END statement, an error, or CTRL-C. The program will restart with the next statement following the previous stopping point. Note that it is not always possible to resume the program correctly â€“ this particularly applies to complex programs with graphics, nested loops and/or nested subroutines and functions.

### CONTINUE DO or

Skip to the end of a DO/LOOP or a FOR/NEXT loop. The loop condition will then be tested and if still valid the loop will continue with the next iteration.

### CONTINUE FOR
