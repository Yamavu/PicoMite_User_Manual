## C]]

coordinates ‘x1’ and ‘y1’ and ending at ‘x2’ and ‘y2’.‘LW’ is the line’s width and is only valid for horizontal or vertical lines. Itdefaults to 1 if not specified. ‘C’ is an integer representing the colour anddefaults to the current foreground colour.All parameters can be expressed as arrays and the software will plot thenumber of lines as determined by the dimensions of the smallest array. 'x1','y1', 'x2', and 'y2' must all be arrays or all be single variables /constantsotherwise an error will be generated. 'lw' and 'c' can be either arrays or singlevariables/constants.For horizontal and vertical lines that have a defined width and the x1 and y1coordinate define the top-left pixel of the thick line. i.e. the line is to the rightof the specified position or below it on the screen. For diagonal lines width awidth > 1 the line is centered on the origin and destination pixels. If width isgiven as a -ve value then lines in all directions are centered on the givencoordinates.
