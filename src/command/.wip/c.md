### C]]

 coordinates ‘x1’ and ‘y1’ and ending at ‘x2’ and ‘y2’. ‘LW’ is the line’s width and is only valid for horizontal or vertical lines. It defaults to 1 if not specified. ‘C’ is an integer representing the colour and defaults to the current foreground colour. All parameters can be expressed as arrays and the software will plot the number of lines as determined by the dimensions of the smallest array. 'x1', 'y1', 'x2', and 'y2' must all be arrays or all be single variables /constants otherwise an error will be generated. 'lw' and 'c' can be either arrays or single variables/constants. For horizontal and vertical lines that have a defined width and the x1 and y1 coordinate define the top-left pixel of the thick line. i.e. the line is to the right of the specified position or below it on the screen. For diagonal lines width a width > 1 the line is centered on the origin and destination pixels. If width is given as a -ve value then lines in all directions are centered on the given coordinates.
