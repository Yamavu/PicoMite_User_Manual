## SYNC

To enable this the command is first called with the parameter time%. This setsup a repeating clock for time% microseconds. The optional parameter ‘period’modifies the time and can be “U” for microseconds, “M” for milliseconds or“S” for seconds.Once the clock is set up the program is synchronised to it using the SYNCcommand without parameters. This waits for the clock period to expire. Forperiods below 2 ms this is non-interruptible. Above 2 ms the program willrespond to Ctrl-C but not any MMBasic interrupts.Typical use is to set the clock outside of a loop and then at the top of the loopcall the SYNC command without parameters. This means the contents of theloop will be executed exactly once for each clock period set.For example, the following would drive a servo with the required precise 50Hztiming: SYNC 20, M DO SYNC PULSE GP0,n LOOP
