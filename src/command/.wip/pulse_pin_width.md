## PULSE pin, width

Will generate a pulse on 'pin' with duration of 'width' ms. 'width' can be afraction. For example, 0.01 is equal to 10µs and this enables the generation ofvery narrow pulses.The generated pulse is of the opposite polarity to the state of the I/O pin whenthe command is executed. For example, if the output is set high the PULSEcommand will generate a negative going pulse.Notes:  'pin' must be configured as an output.  For a pulse of less than 3 ms the accuracy is ± 1 µs.  For a pulse of 3 ms or more the accuracy is ± 0.5 ms.  A pulse of 3 ms or more will run in the background. Up to five different and concurrent pulses can be running in the background and each can have its time changed by issuing a new PULSE command or it can be terminated by issuing a PULSE command with zero for 'width'.
