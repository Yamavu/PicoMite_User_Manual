## FOR counter = start TO finish [STEP increment]

Initiates a FOR-NEXT loop with the 'counter' initially set to 'start' andincrementing in 'increment' steps (default is 1) until 'counter' is greater than'finish'.The ‘increment’ can be an integer or a floating point number. Note that using afloating point fractional number for 'increment' can accumulate rounding errorsin 'counter' which could cause the loop to terminate early or late.
