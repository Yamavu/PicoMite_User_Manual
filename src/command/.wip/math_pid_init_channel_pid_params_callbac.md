## MATH PID INIT channel, pid_params!(), callback

This command sets up a PID controller that can work automatically in thebackground. Up to 8 PID controllers can run simultaneously (channels 1 to 8)‘callback’ is a MMbasic subroutine which is called at the rate defined by thesample time. See the MATH(PID …) function for details of what should beincluded in the subroutine.The pid_params!() array must be dimensioned for all the listed elements,including the controller memory parameters (DIM pid_params!(13)) and beinitialised with the required settings.
