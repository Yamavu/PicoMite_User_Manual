## PWM channel, frequency, [dutyA] [,dutyB][,phase][,defer]

There are 8 separate PWM frequencies available (channels 0 to 7) and up to 16outputs with individually controlled duty cycle. You can output on eitherPWMnA or PWMnB or both for each channel - no restriction. Duty cycles arespecified as a percentage and you can use a negative value to invert the output(-100.0 <= duty <=100.0).To use just channel B use the syntax: ‘PWM channel, frequency, , dutyB’ -note the double comma before the required duty cycle.Minimum frequency = (cpuspeed + 1) / (2^24) Hz. Maximum speed isOPTION CPUSPEED/4. At very fast speeds the duty cycles will beincreasingly limited.Phase is a parameter that causes the waveforms to be centred such that a waveform with a shorter duty cycle starts and ends equal times from a longer one.Use 1 to enable this mode and 0 (or omit) to run as normalThe parameter ‘deferredstart’ when set to 1 configures the PWM channels asbut does not start the output running. They can the be started using the PWMSYNC command. This can be used to avoid any undesirable startup artefactsThe PWM command is also capable of driving servos as follows: PWM 1,50,(position_as_a_percentage * 0.05 + 5)
