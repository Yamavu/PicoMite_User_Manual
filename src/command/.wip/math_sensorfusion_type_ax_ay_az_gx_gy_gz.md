## MATH SENSORFUSION type ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz, mx, my, mz, pitch, roll, yaw [,p1] [,p2]

Type can be MAHONY or MADGWICKAx, ay, and az are the accelerations in the three directions and should bespecified in units of standard gravitational acceleration.Gx, gy, and gz are the instantaneous values of rotational speed which shouldbe specified in radians per second.Mx, my, and mz are the magnetic fields in the three directions and should bespecified in nano-Tesla (nT)Care must be taken to ensure that the x, y and z components are consistentbetween the three inputs. So , for example, using the MPU-9250 the correctinput will be ax, ay,az, gx, gy, gz, my, mx, -mz based on the reading from thesensor.Pitch, roll and yaw should be floating point variables and will contain theoutputs from the sensor fusion.The SENSORFUSION routine will automatically measure the time betweenconsecutive calls and will use this in its internal calculations.The Madwick algorithm takes an optional parameter p1. This is used as beta inthe calculation. It defaults to 0.5 if not specifiedThe Mahony algorithm takes two optional parameters p1, and p2. These areused as Kp and Ki in the calculation. If not specified these default to 10.0 and0.0 respectively.A fully worked example of using the code is given on the BackShed forum at:https://www.thebackshed.com/forum/ViewTopic.php?TID=13459&PID=166962#166962
