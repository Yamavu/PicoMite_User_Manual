### HUMID pin, tvar, hvar [,DHT11]

Returns the temperature and humidity using the DHT22 sensor. Alternative versions of the DHT22 are the AM2303 or the RHT03 (all are compatible). 'pin' is the I/O pin connected to the sensor. Any I/O pin may be used. 'tvar' is the variable that will hold the measured temperature and 'hvar' is the same for humidity. Both must be present and both must be floating point variables. For example: HUMID 3, TEMP!, HUMIDITY! Temperature is measured in ÂºC and the humidity is percent relative humidity. Both will be measured with a resolution of 0.1. If an error occurs (sensor not connected or corrupt signal) both values will be 1000.0. Normally the DHT22 should powered by 3.3V to keep its output below 3.6V for the Raspberry Pi Pico (the Pico 2 does not have this issue) and the signal pin of should be pulled up by a 1K to 10K resistor (4.7K recommended) to 3.3V. The optional DHT11 parameter modifies the timings to work with the DHT11. Set to 1 for DHT11 and 0 or omit for DHT22.
