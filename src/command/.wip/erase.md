### ERASE variable [,variable]..

Deletes global variables and frees up the memory allocated to them. This will work with arrayed variables and normal (non array) variables. Arrays can be specified using empty brackets (eg, dat()) or just by specifying the variable's name (eg, dat). Use CLEAR to delete all variables at the same time (including arrays).
