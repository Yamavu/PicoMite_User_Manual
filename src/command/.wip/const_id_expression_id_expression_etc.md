## CONST id = expression [, id = expression] â€¦ etc

Create a constant identifier which cannot be changed once created.'id' is the identifier which follows the same rules as for variables. Theidentifier can have a type suffix (!, %, or $) but it is not required. If it isspecified it must match the type of 'expression'. 'expression' is the value of theidentifier and it can be a normal expression (including user defined functions)which will be evaluated when the constant is created.A constant defined outside a sub or function is global and can be seenthroughout the program. A constant defined inside a sub or function is local tothat routine and will hide a global constant with the same name.
