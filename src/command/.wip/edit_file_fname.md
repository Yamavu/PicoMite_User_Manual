## EDIT FILE fname$

filename is also created on exit.If fname$ includes an extension other than .bas then colour coding will betemporarily turned off during the edit.If no extension is specified the firmware will assume .basEditing a file from disk allows non-Basic files such as html or sprite files to beedited without corruption during the tokenising process that happens whenstored to flash.EDIT and EDIT fname$ can only be invoked at the command prompt.If you wish to edit a file in a program you can use the EDIT FILE fname$command. The command must be used in the top level program and not fromwithin a subroutine.EDIT FILE fname$ differs from EDIT fname$ in that it will automatically savethe entire variable space to the A: drive and restores it on exit. The commandwill fail if there is not enough free space on the A: drive. In the case of anRP2350 with PSRAM the variable space will be saved to a reserved area in thePSRAM and the A: drive is not used.See the chapter Full Screen Editor for details of how to use the editor.
