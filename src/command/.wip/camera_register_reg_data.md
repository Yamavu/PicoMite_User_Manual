## CAMERA REGISTER reg%, data%

Sets the register "reg%" in the camera to the value "data%". When used thecommand will report to the console the previous value and automaticallyconfirms that the new value has been set as requested. The colour rendition ofthe camera as initialised is reasonable but could probably be improved furtherby tuning the various camera registers.
