 is full RGB555 allowing good quality colour images to be displayed. A framebuffer (F) and a layer buffer (L) can be created. These have no impact on the display and can be used for creating images and copying to the display screen (N). Only one can be createdMODE 5 360 x 200 x 256 colours. A framebuffer (F) can be created. This has no impact on the display. It can be used for creating images and copying to the display screen (N). In addition a layer buffer can be created. This does not use user memory. Any pixels written to the layer buffer will automatically appear on the display sitting on top of whatever may be in the main display buffer. A colour can be specified (0-255: defaults to 0) which does not show allowing the main display buffer to show through. Map functionality is available to override the default colours of the 256 available. Each of the 256 colours can be mapped to any RGB555 colour.
