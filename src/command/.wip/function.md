### FUNCTION xxx (arg1 [,arg2, …]) [AS <type>} <statements> <statements> xxx = <return value>

 Defines a callable function. This is the same as adding a new function to MMBasic while it is running your program. 'xxx' is the function name and it must meet the specifications for naming a variable. The type of the function can be specified by using a type suffix (i.e. xxx$) or by specifying the type using AS <type> at the end of the functions
