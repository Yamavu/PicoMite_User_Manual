## INPUT ["prompt$";] var1 [,var2 [, var3 [, etc]]]

Will take a list of values separated by commas (,) entered at the console andwill assign them to a sequential list of variables.For example, if the command is: INPUT a, b, cAnd the following is typed on the keyboard: 23, 87, 66Then a = 23 and b = 87 and c = 66The list of variables can be a mix of float, integer or string variables. Thevalues entered at the console must correspond to the type of variable.If a single value is entered a comma is not required (however that value cannotcontain a comma).‘prompt$’ is a string constant (not a variable or expression) and if specified itwill be printed first. Normally the prompt is terminated with a semicolon (;)and in that case a question mark will be printed following the prompt. If theprompt is terminated with a comma (,) rather than the semicolon (;) thequestion mark will be suppressed.
