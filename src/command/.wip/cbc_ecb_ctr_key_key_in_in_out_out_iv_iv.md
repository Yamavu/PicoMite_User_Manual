## CBC/ECB/CTR key$/key(), in$/in(), out$/out() [,iv$/iv()]

The parameters can each be either a string, integer array, or float array with anymix possibleThe key must be 16 elements long (16*8=128bits), in and out must be amultiple of 16 elements long. In the case of out being specified as a string (e.g.out$), the string variable must exist and should be set to empty (DIM out$="")The maximum number of elements in 'in' and 'out' is limited by memory whendefined as arrays. Strings for encrypting are limited to 240bytes (EBR) and224bytes (CTR and CBC).For CBC and CTR encryption you can optionally specify an initialisationvector 'iv'. 'iv' must be 16 elements long (16*8=128bits). If an initialisationvector is not specified encryption will generate a random initialisation vector.In both cases the output is prepended with the IV.For CBC and CTR, decryption requires that the first 16 elements of the inputare the initialisation vector.In the case where you want to transmit a message without IV you shouldremove the IV before sending the message using standard MMBasicmanipulations. In this case the recipient must know the IV as well as the keyand create a complete message before using DECRYPT by prepending the IVto the incoming message.
