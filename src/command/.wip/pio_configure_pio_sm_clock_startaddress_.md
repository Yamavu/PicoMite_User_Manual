The parameters in this command are essentially the same as you would use inthe PIO INIT command plus the helper functions PINCTRL, SHIFTCTRL andEXECCTRL but combined into a single command. This is required becausethe Pico sdk does some very clever processing behind the scenes to handle theRP2350B‘sidesetbase’, ‘sidebase outbase’, ‘inbase’ and ‘jmppin’ are pin definitions.You can specify these as either a GPno or a pin number (e.g. GP3 or 5). In allcases specify the actual pin. So if PIO SET BASE is set to 16 for that PIO thenvalues GP16 to GP47 are valid. If PIO SET BASE is not set or is set to 0 thenpins GP0 to GP31 are valid. They all default to the base set except ‘jmppin’(defaults to -1) which needs to be explicitly set if you want to use a ‘jmppin’ asthis triggers setting the required status bit‘clock’ is the desired PIO clock speed in Hz‘startaddress’ is the PIO statement that will start execution - defaults to 0‘sidesetno’, ‘setno’ and ‘outno’ specify the number of pins that can be used forthose functions - default to 0‘sidesetout’, ‘setout’ and ‘outout’ specify if those pins should be configured asoutputs (1=yes, 0=no) - default to 0‘wraptarget and ‘wrap’ are in the range 0-31 and default to 0 and 31‘inshiftdir’ and ‘outshiftdir’ default to 1 - shift out of output shift register toright and shift input shift register to right (data enters from left).All other parameters are booleans that can enable a specific function - 1 toenable 0 to disable - all default to 0.Simple example:'PIO Configure pio, sm, clock, startaddress,'sidesetbase, sidesetno, sidesetout,'setbase, setno, setout, outbase, outno, outout, inbase,'jmppin, wraptarget, wrap, sideenable, sidepindir,'pushthreshold, pullthreshold, autopush, autopull, inshiftdir, outshiftdir,'joinrxfifo, jointxfifo, joinrxfifoget, joinrxfifoputPIO assemble 1.program test.line 0.wrap targetSet pins,1Set pins,0.wrap.end programSetPin gp45,pio1PIO set base 1,16PIO configure 1,0,1000000,,,,,gp45,1,1,,,,,,Pio(.wrap target),Pio(.wrap)PIO start 1,0DoLoopAlthough the PIO CONFIGURE command has many parameters, it is veryeasy to use if you adopt this simple approach: Copy the comment lines in theexample into your program. For each parameter substitute your required valueor delete the parameter leaving the commas intact.Once all substitutions are done delete any trailing commasThen assuming the line will be too long for the editor delete the CRs one byone starting at the end of the second last line and moving upwards.In this way you will have a valid command that is easy to input and edit.NB: You can also use continuation lines to make the editing easier (seeOPTION CONTINUATION LINES)
