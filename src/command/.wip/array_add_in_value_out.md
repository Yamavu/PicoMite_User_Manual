## ARRAY ADD in(), value ,out()

This adds (or appends for strings) the value 'value' to every element of thematrix in() and puts the answer in out(). Works for arrays of anydimensionality of strings and both integer and float (can convert betweeninteger and float). Setting num to 0 or “” is optimised and is a fast way ofcopying an entire array. in() and out() can be the same array.
