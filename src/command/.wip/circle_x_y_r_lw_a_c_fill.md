## CIRCLE x, y, r [,lw] [, a] [, c] [, fill]

Draw a circle centred at 'x' and 'y' with a radius of 'r' on the display output. ‘lw’is optional and is the line width (defaults to 1). 'c' is the optional colour and defaults to the current foreground colour if notspecified. The optional 'a' is a floating point number which will define theaspect ratio. If the aspect is not specified the default is 1.0 which gives astandard circle. 'fill' is the fill colour and can be omitted or set to -1 in whichcase the box will not be filled.All parameters can be expressed as arrays and the software will plot thenumber of circles as determined by the dimensions of the smallest array. 'x','y' and 'r' must all be arrays or all be single variables/constants otherwise anerror will be generated. 'lw', 'a', 'c', and fill can be either arrays or singlevariables/constants.See the chapter Graphics Commands and Functions for a definition of thecolours and graphics coordinates.
