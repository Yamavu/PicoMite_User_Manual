## PLAY SOUND soundno, channelno, type [,frequency] [,volume]

'soundno' is the sound number and can be from 1 to 4 allowing for foursimultaneous sounds on each channel.'channelno' specifies the output channel. It can be L (left speaker), R (rightspeaker), B (both speakers). type' specifies the wave form to be used. It can be S (Sine wave), Q (squarewave) , T (triangular wave) , W (saw tooth) , O (Null output), P (periodicnoise), N (random noise) or U (user defined using PLAY LOAD SOUND).'frequency' is the frequency from 1 to 20000 (Hz) and it must be specifiedexcept when type is O. In Type U mode, this parameter can also acceptdecimal values. For example, all of the following will play back the waveformat its original pitch: Sample rate of 4000, frequency = 1 Sample rate of 8000, frequency = 2 Sample rate of 16000, frequency = 4'volume' is optional and must be between 1 and 25. It defaults to 25When PLAY SOUND is called all other audio usage will be blocked and willremain blocked until PLAY STOP is called. Output can be stoppedtemporarily using PLAY PAUSE and PLAY RESUME.Calling SOUND on an already running 'soundno' will immediately replace theprevious output. Individual sounds are turned off using type “O”Running 4 sounds simultaneously on both channels of the audio outputconsumes about 23% of the CPU.
