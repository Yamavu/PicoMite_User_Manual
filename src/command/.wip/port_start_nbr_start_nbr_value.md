## PORT(start, nbr [,start, nbr]â€¦) = value

Set a number of I/O pins simultaneously (i.e. with one command).'start' is an I/O pin number and the lowest bit in 'value' (bit 0) will be used toset that pin. Bit 1 will be used to set the pin 'start' plus 1, bit 2 will set pin'start'+2 and so on for 'nbr' number of bits. I/O pins used must be numberedconsecutively and any I/O pin that is invalid or not configured as an output willcause an error. The start/nbr pair can be repeated if an additional group ofoutput pins needed to be added.For example; PORT(15, 4, 23, 4) = &B10000011Will set eight I/O pins. Pins 15 and 16 will be set high while 17, 18, 23, 24 and25 will be set to a low and finally 26 will be set high.This command can be used to conveniently communicate with parallel deviceslike LCD displays. Any number of I/O pins (and therefore bits) can be usedfrom 1 to the number of I/O pins on the chip.See the PORT function to simultaneously read from a number of pins.
