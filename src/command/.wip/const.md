### CONST id = expression [, id = expression] â€¦ etc

 Create a constant identifier which cannot be changed once created. 'id' is the identifier which follows the same rules as for variables. The identifier can have a type suffix (!, %, or $) but it is not required. If it is specified it must match the type of 'expression'. 'expression' is the value of the identifier and it can be a normal expression (including user defined functions) which will be evaluated when the constant is created. A constant defined outside a sub or function is global and can be seen throughout the program. A constant defined inside a sub or function is local to that routine and will hide a global constant with the same name.
