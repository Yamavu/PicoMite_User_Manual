ONS ONLY supports a number of resolutions (see OPTION RESOLUTION).

### MODE 2 This comm

and will select the mode ‘n’ depending on the resolution:

### MODE 3 (RP2350 only) MODE 1 6

40 x 480 x 2 colours (monochrome). Default at startup. Tiles width is fixed at 8 pixels. Tile height defaults to 12 pixels but can be from 8 to MM.HRES. Tiles colours are specified using the standard RGB888 notation. This is converted to RGB121. A framebuffer (F) and a layer buffer (L) can be created. These have no impact on the display and do not use user memory but both can be used for creating images and copying to the display screen (N)

### MODE 2 3

20 x 240 x 16 colours. RGB121 format (i.e. 1 bit for red, 2 bits for green, and 1 bit for blue). A framebuffer (F) can be created. This have no impact on the display and does not use user memory but can be used for creating images and copying to the display screen (N). In addition a layer buffer can be created. This also does not use user memory. any pixels written to the layer buffer will automatically appear on the display sitting on top of whatever may be in the main display buffer. A colour can be specified (0-15: defaults to 0) which does not show allowing the main display buffer to show through. Map functionality is available to override the default colours of the 16 available. The hardware is limited to the 16 colours defined by the resistor network
