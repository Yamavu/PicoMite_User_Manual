## FRAMEBUFFER MERGE [colour] [,mode] [,updaterate]

Copies the contents of the Layer buffer and Framebuffer onto the LCD displayomitting all pixels of a particular colour. Preconditions for the commandare that FRAMEBUFFER and LAYERBUFFER are both createdFRAMEBUFFER MERGE - writes the contents of the framebuffer to thephysical display overwriting any pixels in the framebuffer that are set in thelayerbuffer (not zero)FRAMEBUFER MERGE col - writes the contents of the framebuffer to thephysical display overwriting any pixels in the framebuffer that are in thelayerbuffer not set to the transparent colour "col". The colour is specified as anumber between 0 and 15 representing:0:BLACK,1:BLUE,2:MYRTLE,3:COBALT,4:MIDGREEN,5:CERULEAN,6:GREEN,7:CYAN,8:RED,9:MAGENTA,10:RUST,11:FUCHSIA,12:BROWN,13:LILAC,14:YELLOW,15:WHITEFRAMEBUFFER MERGE col,B - as above except that the transfer to thephysical display takes place on the second CPU and control returns to BasicimmediatelyFRAMEBUFFER MERGE col,R [,updaterate] - sets the second CPU tocontinuously update the physical display with the merger of the two buffers.Automatically sets FRAMEBUFFER WRITE F if not F or L already set. Bydefault the screen will update as fast as possible (At 200MHz an ILI9341 inSPI mode updates about 13 times a second, in 8-bit parallel mode the ILI9341achieves 27 FPS)If "updaterate" is set then the screen will update to the rate specified inmilliseconds (unless that is less than the fastest achievable on the display)NB: FRAMEBUFFER WRITE cannot be set to N while continuous mergedupdate is active.FRAMEBUFFER MERGE col,A - aborts the continuous updatesIn addition deleting either the layerbuf or framebuffer, ctrl-C, or END willabort the automatic update as well.
