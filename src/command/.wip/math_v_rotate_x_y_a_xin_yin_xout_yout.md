## MATH V_ROTATE x, y, a, xin(), yin(), xout(), yout()

This command rotates the coordinate pairs in “xin()” and “yin()” around thecentre point defined by “x” and “y” by the angle “a” and puts the results in“xout()” and “yout()”. NB: the input and output arrays can be the same and therotation angle is, by default, in radians but this can be changed using the
