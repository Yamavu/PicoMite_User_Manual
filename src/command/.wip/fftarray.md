## FFTarray!()

must be floating point and the size must be a power of 2 (eg, s(1023) assumingOPTION BASE is zero)"FFTarray" must be floating point and have dimension 2*N where N is thesame as the signal array (eg, f(1,1023) assuming OPTION BASE is zero)The command will return the FFT as complex numbers with the real part inf(0,n) and the imaginary part in f(1,n)
