## LIST ALL [fname$]

LIST ALL will list the program without pauses. This is useful if you wish totransfer the program to a terminal emulator on a PC that has the ability tocapture its input stream to a file. If the optional ‘fname$’ is specified then that file on the Flash Filesystem or SDCard will be listed.
