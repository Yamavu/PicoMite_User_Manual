## BLIT MEMORY address, x, y [,col]

Copies an area of memory treated as a packed array of colour nibbles to thecurrent graphical output as specified by FRAMEBUFFER WRITE. The colouris specified as a number between 0 and 15 representing:Black, Blue, Myrtle, Cobalt, Midgreen, Cerulean, green, cyan, red, magenta,rust, fuschia, brown, lilac, yellow and whiteThe first word of the area of memory starting at ‘address%’ must contain thewidth and height of the area to be copied as 16-bit integers with the width asthe bottom 16 bits. The address must be aligned to a word boundary (divisibleby 4).If the optional parameter ‘col’ is specified then that specific colour is notcopied.If the top bit of either the width or height is set to 1 then the colour data istreated as compressed (the remaining 15 bits are used as the width and/orheight). The compression algorithm is simple, each byte contains a count in thebottom nibble (1-15) and a colour in the top nibble (0-15). In the event thatmore than 15 pixels are the same colour additional bytes are used for thatcolour.
