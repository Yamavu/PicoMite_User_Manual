## WATCHDOG HW OFF

(WATCHDOG HW command).If the hardware watchdog is used the timer has a maximum of 8.3 seconds. Nosuch limitation exists for the software watchdog.'timeout' is the time in milliseconds (ms) before a restart is forced. Thiscommand should be placed in strategic locations in the running BASICprogram to constantly reset the watchdog timer (to ‘timeout’) and thereforeprevent it from counting down to zero.If the timer count does reach zero (perhaps because the BASIC program hasstopped running) the PicoMite firmware will be automatically restarted and theautomatic variable MM.WATCHDOG will be set to true (i.e. 1) indicating thatan error occurred. On a normal startup MM.WATCHDOG will be set to false(i.e. 0). Note that OPTION AUTORUN must be specified for the program torestart.WATCHDOG OFF can be used to disable the watchdog timer (this is thedefault on a reset or power up). The timer is also turned off when the breakcharacter (CTRL-C) is used on the console to interrupt a running program.
