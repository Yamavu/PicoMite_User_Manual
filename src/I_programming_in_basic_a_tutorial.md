# Programming in BASIC - A Tutorial

The BASIC language was introduced in 1964 by Dartmouth College in the USA as a computer
language for teaching programming and accordingly it is easy to use and learn. At the same time, it
has proved to be a competent and powerful programming language and as a result it became very
popular in the late 70s and early 80s. Even today some large commercial data systems are still written
in the BASIC language (primarily Pick Basic).

The BASIC interpreter used in the PicoMite firmwareâ€™s is called MMBasic and is a modern version of
the BASIC language which loosely emulates the Microsoft BASIC interpreter that was popular years
ago.

For a programmer the greatest advantage of BASIC is its ease of use. Some more modern languages
such as C and C++ can be truly mind bending but with BASIC you can start with a one line program
and get something sensible out of it. MMBasic is also powerful in that you can draw sophisticated
graphics, manipulate the external I/O pins to control other devices and communicate with other
devices using a range of built-in communications protocols.
