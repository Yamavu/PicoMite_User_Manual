## OPTION LEGACY ON <br> OPTION LEGACY OFF

This will turn on or off compatibility mode with the graphic commands used in the original Colour Maximite. The commands `COLOUR`, `LINE`, `CIRCLE` and `PIXEL` use the legacy syntax and all drawing commands will accept colours in the range of 0 to 7.

Notes:
* Keywords such as RED, BLUE, etc are not implemented so they should be defined as constants if needed.
* Refer to the Colour Maximite MMBasic Language Manual for the syntax of the legacy commands. This can be downloaded from https://geoffg.net/OriginalColourMaximite.html .
