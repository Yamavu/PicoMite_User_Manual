## OPTION COLOURCODE ON <br> OPTION COLOURCODE OFF

#permanent

Turn on or off colour coding for the editor's output. Keywords will be in cyan, comments in yellow, etc. The default is OFF.

The keyword `COLORCODE` (USA spelling) can also be used.

This will work on VGA/HDMI video and the serial console using a terminal emulator with VT100 emulation (eg, Tera Term). This
command must be run at the command prompt (not in a program).
