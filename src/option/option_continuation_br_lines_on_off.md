## OPTION CONTINUATION<br>LINES ON/OFF

Enables or disables the use of continuation lines in the editor and with the `LIST` command. Line continuation is indicated by a space followed by an underscore character at the end of a line.

When enabled the editor will automatically split lines as it reads them from file and add the continuation characters required. When exiting the editor, the continuation characters are removed before saving. While in the editor the user can create long lines by adding their own continuation characters. This makes using a small screen as a console much easier.
