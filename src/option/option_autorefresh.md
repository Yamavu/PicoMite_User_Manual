# OPTION AUTOREFRESH OFF | ON

Black and white displays can only be updated a full screen at a time. By using OPTION AUTOREFRESH OFF/ON you can control whether a write command immediately updates the display or not. 

If `AUTOREFRESH` is `OFF` the `REFRESH` command can be used to
trigger the write. This applies to the following displays: N5110, SSD1306I2C, SSD1306I2C32, SSD1306SPI and ST7920
