## OPTION EXPLICIT

Placing this command at the start of a program will require that every variable be explicitly declared using the `DIM`, `LOCAL` or `STATIC` commands before it can be used in the program.

This option is disabled by default when a program is run. If it is used it must be specified before any variables are used.
