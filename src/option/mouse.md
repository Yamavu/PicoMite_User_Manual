## OPTION MOUSE CLKpin, DATApin

*non USB firmware only*

Set the pins to be used to connect a PS2 mouse.

Using this command the mouse is automatically configured on boot and you can set up interrupts and read values with no additional commands. This is different from the `MOUSE OPEN` which only connects to a mouse while the program is running. The PS2 mouse *must* be is disabled.
