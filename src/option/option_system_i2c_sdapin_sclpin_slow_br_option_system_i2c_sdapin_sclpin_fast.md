# OPTION SYSTEM I2C sdapin, sclpin [,SLOW]<br>OPTION SYSTEM I2C sdapin, sclpin [,FAST]

Specify the IÂ²C port and pins for use by system devices (LCD panel, and RTC).

The PicoMite firmware uses a specific I2C port for system devices, leaving the other for the programmer. This command specifies which pins are to be used, and hence which of the I2C ports is to be used.

The pins allocated to the SYSTEM I2C will not be available for other MMBasic SETPIN settings but can be used for additional I2C devices using the standard I2C command. Note: I2C(2) OPEN and I2C(2) CLOSE are not available in this case.

By default the I2C port is opened at a speed of 400KHz and with a 100mSec timeout. The I2C frequency can be set using the optional third parameter which can take the values FAST = 400KHz or SLOW = 100KHz.

*This command must be run at the command prompt (not in a program).*
