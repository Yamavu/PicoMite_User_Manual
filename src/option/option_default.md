# OPTION DEFAULT FLOAT | INTEGER | STRING | NONE

Used to set the default type for a variable which is not explicitly defined.

If `OPTION DEFAULT NONE` is used then all variables must have their type explicitly defined or the error `Variable type not specified` will occur.

When a program is run the default is set to `FLOAT` for compatibility with Microsoft BASIC and previous versions of MMBasic.
