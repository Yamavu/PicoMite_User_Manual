## OPTION DISK SAVE fname$<br>OPTION DISK LOAD fname$

These commands let the user save the complete set of options defined to and from a disk file. 

The file could then be transferred to a host computer using `XMODEM` allowing additional devices to be easily configured or options recovered after a firmware upgrade.
