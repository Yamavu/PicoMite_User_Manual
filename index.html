                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The PicoMite is a Raspberry Pi Pico running the MMBasic interpreter. MMBasic is a Microsoft BASIC compatible implementation of the BASIC language with floating point, integer, and string variables, arrays, and many other features. Using MMBasic, you can control I/O pins, use communication protocols like IÂ²C or SPI to get data from sensors, and display information on low-cost colour LCD displays. The PicoMite firmware is totally free to download and use.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">The emphasis with MMBasic is on ease of use and development. The development cycle is very fast, with the ability to instantly switch from edit to run. Errors are listed in plain English, and when an error does occur, a single keystroke will invoke the built-in editor with the cursor positioned on the line that caused the error.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Getting Started</h2>
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Loading the PicoMite Firmware</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The Raspberry Pi Pico comes with its own built-in firmware loader that is easy to use. To get started, download the PicoMite firmware from the official website and unzip the file. Then, plug the Pico into your computer while holding down the white BOOTSEL button. A virtual drive named RPI-RP2 will appear. Copy the firmware file (.uf2) to this drive, and the Pico will restart with the new firmware.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Commands and Program Input</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">At the MMBasic command prompt (the '>' symbol), you can enter a command and it will be immediately run. This allows you to test out commands or set options. To enter a program, the easiest method is to use the  command, which invokes the full-screen program editor. You can also compose programs on your desktop computer and transfer them to the PicoMite.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">File System</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The PicoMite supports both an internal file system and an external SD Card formatted as FAT16 or FAT32. This allows for flexible program and data storage. You can read, write, and open files for random access, as well as load and save programs. The internal file system is case-sensitive, while the SD Card file system is not. Commands like , , and  allow you to manage files and directories.</p>
