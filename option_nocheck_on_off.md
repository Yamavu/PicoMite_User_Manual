# OPTION NOCHECK ON/OFF

This command, when set **ON**, disables the standard checking for interrupts and **ctrl-C** at the end of every command. Setting it to `ON` allows time critical processing to take place without risk of interruption.

However, the command should be used carefully or the program may only be stopped with a H/W reset.
